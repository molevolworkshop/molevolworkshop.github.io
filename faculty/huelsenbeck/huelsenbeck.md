[C++ MCMC estimation of coin's bias]({{ site.baseurl }}/faculty/huelsenbeck/data/WoodsHoleMcmc.zip)

[coin_flip_mcmc.py]({{ site.baseurl }}/faculty/huelsenbeck/data/coin_flip_mcmc.py) - a Python program that implements the MCMC for estimating a coin's bias based on a number of heads and tails observed. This is not the code written during the lecture by John. It is an equivalent version of John's C++ implementation written (by Mark Holder) using the Python programming language. If you download it, then you can run it (from a Terminal) with the command 
    python coin_flip_mcmc.py
