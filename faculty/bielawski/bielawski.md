## 1.6 &nbsp; Scientific ethics

**2025 Ethics Lecture Resource**

* **Lecture slides:** [slides](http://awarnach.mathstat.dal.ca/~joeb/PAML_lab/slides/Ethics_into_2025_A.pdf)

* Free copy of the "**Applied Ethics Primer**": [https://caul-cbua.pressbooks.pub/aep/](https://caul-cbua.pressbooks.pub/aep/)
<br>

**Supplemental Reading** (how such rules can privilege members of some groups and serve as a barrier others) 

*  &nbsp; We recently wrote a paper called ["Ten simple rules for succeeding as an underrepresented STEM undergraduate"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010101) to help make explicit the "*hidden curriculum*" of science.

* &nbsp; Many of the *unwritten rules* of science are the same as those that operate in society at large, including racism operating within people who adhere to egalitarian attitudes. In the essay [“Science in the Belly of the Beast: my Career in the Academy”](http://awarnach.mathstat.dal.ca/~joeb/PAML_lab/resources/Belly_of_the_Beast_2012.pdf) Joseph L. Graves, Jr. describes his personal experience with the "*unwritten rules*" of the academy, including the "*one and one-quarter rule*".

* &nbsp; Here is a copy of [“Snow Brown and the Seven Detergents: A Metanarrative on Science and the Scientific Method.”](http://awarnach.mathstat.dal.ca/~joeb/PAML_lab/resources/SnowBrown.pdf) by Banu Sbramaniam (Women's Studies Quarterly, Vol. 28, No. 1/2, (2000), pp. 296-304.)

## 2.2 &nbsp; Alternative lab and advanced inferences

If you have some experience with codon models, and want to try out a tutorial for more advanced materials then use the link below to download an archive for a complete different set of PAML activities.  This tutorial focuses on detecting episodic protein evolution via **Branch-Site Model A**.  The tutorial also includes activities about (i) detecting **MLE instabilities**, (ii) carrying out **robustness analyses**, and (iii) use of **smoothed bootstrap aggregation (SBA)**.  The protocols for each activity are presented in Protocols in Bioinformatics UNIT 6.15.  The included PDF file for UNIT 6.16 also presents recommendations for "best practices" when carrying out a large-scale evolutionary survey for episodic adaptive evolution by using PAML.  The files required for this "alternative lab" are available via Bitbucket repository.  The repository link is given below.

**Advanced PAML demo:** [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/EvoWorks/protocol-inference-of-episodic-selection/downloads)

**codeml_SBA:**  a program that implements Smoothed Bootstrap Aggregation (SBA) for assessing selection pressure at amino acid sites. [https://github.com/Jehops/codeml_sba](https://github.com/Jehops/codeml_sba)<br>

**DendroCypher:** a program to assist labelling the branches of a Newick-formatted tree-file for use with a “branch model” or a “branch-site codon model": [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/EvoWorks/dendrocypher/downloads/)

## 2.3 &nbsp; Best practices in large-scale evolutionary surveys

Large-scale evolutionary surveys are now commonplace. But with the use of progressively more complex codon models, these surveys are fraught with perils. Complex models are more prone to statistical problems such as MLE irregularities, and some can be quite sensitive to model misspecification.  UNIT 6.16 (see above) provides some recommended "best practices" for a **2-phase approach** to quality control and robustness in evolutionary surveys.  We have applied these to a large scale survey for functional divergence in nuclear receptors during homing evolution, and we used experimental approaches to investigate hypotheses about the role of a particular nuclear receptor (NR2C1) as a key modulator of developmental pluripotnetiality during hominid evolution. The paper that illustrates the power of such an evolutionary surgery, and the importance of an experimental design having explicit protocols for "best practices", is given below.
