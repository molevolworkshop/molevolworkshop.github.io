Here are the steps to starting the Jupyter notebook that shows machine learning in action:

1. After logging into your virtual machine, navigate to `~/moledata/machinelearning`
2. Enter `. go.sh` (or the more verbose equivalent `source go.sh`)
3. Copy the URL specified in the last line of output into a web browser on your local laptop
4. Click on the Jupyter notebook file `Machine_Learning_for_Population_Genetics_V2.ipynb` to open it
5. Change the kernel to `MOLE` using the **Kernel > Change kernel** menu item (the default kernel will not work)
6. Run each section of the notebook by repeatedly pressing the **Run** button. Most sections finish almost instantaneously, but the ones that require computation will be slower. Be sure to wait for a couple of seconds before pressing the **Run** button again to make sure it is not still computing.
When done, hit the **Logout** button at the top until you have logged out of all browser windows
7. Back in the terminal of your virtual machine, press Ctrl-C twice (or maybe three times) to quit the server and return to your bash prompt.
