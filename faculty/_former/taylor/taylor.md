### Arrival and Departure

May 26 to June 7

### About me

I study evolution in insects, and I am interested in understanding how evolutionary processes shape the genome over time and in identifying the genomic basis of key traits.

I recently completed my PhD in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at University of Connecticut with Dr. Charles Henry as my major advisor. I am currently working as a postdoc in the lab of Dr. Megan Fritz in the Department of Entomology at the University of Maryland.
