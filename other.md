## T-shirts

Each year, workshop participants and faculty hold a competition to decide the t-shirt design for that year. Click the link below for the fossil history of t-shirt designs all the way back to the beginning of time (i.e. 1988). Note: there are unfortunately a few holes in the fossil record.
